# AFDB cluster definitions

The `afdb_cluster_definitions.json` file contains the definitions of AFDB clusters that were generated using the pipeline described in the BioEmu manuscript. Each entry in the dictionary maps a cluster representative to the members of the cluster in the format `[afdb_entry, pLDDT mean, pLDDT standard deviation]`.
